## Using repository

Clone the repository and make changes to dev-branch. Stable code will be merged to main by creating a pull request.  

Remember to pull changes from remote before starting to work  
If you get stuck with having your own changes and incoming changes from remote,  
stash your changes, pull incoming, pop stash and you should be good to go. If you  
have made commits already to local repository, merge incoming commits to your local  branch without rebase.
